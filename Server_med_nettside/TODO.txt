===     TODO List    ===

- Group functions in index.js into a single objective (myFuncs).
  Other .js files imported to website might have its own functions with the same name.

- inside index.js:  var dataTable should be created with data from server -> firebase.
  Upon loading the website should create dataTable from firebase.
  it will then be updated every time esp sends new data to the server.
  Consider creating a new function for creating dataTable.

- [Client].click() -> reload datatable (from firebase) & reload graphs (data from firebase)



---   Less important  ---

- Group constants such as port and host etc to one document.
  link this document to server.js and client.js etc.

- in HTML:      <script src="socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
  Is something like this possible?:
                <script src="socket.io/socket.io.js" alt="node_modules/socket.io-client/dist/socket.io.js"></script>
  In english: If file not found on the internet --> Use local file.

- Download Jquery and import it from local files. (See bottom of index.html) (Optional)

- jquery is installed using npm. But also accessed throught CDN (botton of index.html)
  Uninstall jquery if its not used.

  INTO INDEX.HTML:
  <!--   FIREBASE   -->
  <!-- core Firebase JS -->
  <script src="__/firebase/7.24.0/firebase-app.js"></script>
  <!-- TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
     https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries -->
